**Project Name:**
Coffee Shop Project

**Important Note:**
I created the coffee shop operations csv to implement other calculations that may further the analysis of the operations. 

**Skills Acquired:**
1) Data Visualization
2) Data Cleaning
3) Pareto Analysis
4) Coorelation Matrix
5) Utilizing chatGPT/Co-Pilot to help me learn python faster

**Project Description:**
In this project, I analyzed a collection of transaction details among the menu items in a coffee shop. I statistically analyzed the purchases of the menu items to grab the big picture. Created bar charts, pie graphs and a correlation matrix to visualize the data. The correlation matrix determined which two products were most likely to be sold within the same transaction. Later I also implemented a Pareto Chart illustrating which products accumulated to 80% of the quantity sold and profits.
